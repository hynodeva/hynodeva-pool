Pool Payoutmodes:

PPS: 
	3.2% on income, payouts every 30minutes

Proportional:
	0.5% on income, payouts when block is confirmed (120 for Proof of Work coins, 540 for proof of stake coins)
	
Hynodeva:
	0.1% on income + 0.01 Coins per worker per block basefee, payouts when block is confirmed (120 for Proof of Work coins, 540 for proof of stake coins)
	This payoutmode is for large rigs which have a significant portion of the poolspeed.

Attention: Do not use one worker with more then one instance of your mining software, otherwise LongPoll might fail.

All payouts are calculated per worker, so you can set up different workers with different payout structure
